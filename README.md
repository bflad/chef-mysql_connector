* Include `recipe[mysql_connector::j]` in your node's run list

### MySQL Connector/J installation via LWRP

* Add `depends "mysql_connector"` to cookbook metadata
* Add to cookbook recipe:

```ruby
include_recipe "mysql_connector"
mysql_connector_j "/path/to/install/location"
```

## Testing and Development

Here's how you can quickly get testing or developing against the cookbook thanks to [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) and [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/).

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
    git clone git://github.com/bflad/chef-mysql_connector.git
    cd chef-mysql_connector
    vagrant up BOX # BOX being centos5, centos6, debian7, fedora18, fedora19, fedora20, freebsd9, ubuntu1204, ubuntu1210, ubuntu1304, or ubuntu1310

You can then SSH into the running VM using the `vagrant ssh BOX` command.

The VM can easily be stopped and deleted with the `vagrant destroy` command. Please see the official [Vagrant documentation](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/index.html) for a more in depth explanation of available commands.
